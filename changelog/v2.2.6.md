# Version 2.2.6

## ‚úîÔ∏è What's new

- Magic 8-Ball Command: Simply call it using `8ball`
- Wild Pok√©mon you can catch by typing their name correctly (either in English or German)! The system is still under construction but as soon as it's finished they will spawn in specific channels you can set. Gotta catch 'em all.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Changes

- Most commands now have unique embed colors and a better help page.
- Anime and Manga search commands have been updated to support the new API version. Searches may show little to no results since the API now queries their own DB instead of scraping MyAnimeList (which often shows random search results).
- The infrastructure of Holo has been improved once more, most command misusages and errors should return a (somewhat) more helpful message.
- Holo now automatically leaves a voice channel as soon as everyone left.

## üêú Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug that occasionally broke Anime and Manga search commands. With the new API they should be much quicker and more stable.
